When it melts and freezes over and over again it turns into ice This ice can become very heavy and starts to move down valleys The speed at which move depends on the climate When it gets colder get bigger and move downwards When it gets warmer over longer period of time melt and retreat back to the tops of the mountains In some cases can move up to km or even more every year When moves over land
